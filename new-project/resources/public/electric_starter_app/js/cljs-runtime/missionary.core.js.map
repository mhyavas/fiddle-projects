A group is a flow\nconsuming values matching a key. Upstream values are dispatched in constant time to their group consumer.\n\nCancelling a group consumer makes it fail immediately. If a value is subsequently found for the same grouping, the\nkey-group pair is produced again, including in the special case where the consumer is cancelled while a transfer was\npending. Cancelling a group consumer has no effect when the main process is cancelled.\n\nIf upstream fails, or if the key function throws, then upstream is cancelled and flushed and the error is propagated\ndownstream.\n\nWhen the last upstream value is consumed, downstream terminates along with each active consumer and subsequent ones.\n\nConcurrent consumers on a single group are not allowed, attempting to do so will fail the latest consumer.\n\nExample :\n```clojure\n(def words [\\\"Air\\\" \\\"Bud\\\" \\\"Cup\\\" \\\"Awake\\\" \\\"Break\\\" \\\"Chunk\\\" \\\"Ant\\\" \\\"Big\\\" \\\"Check\\\"])\n(def groups\n  (m/ap (let [[k >x] (m/?= (m/group-by (juxt first count) (m/seed words)))]\n          [k (m/?
